# Foreign-Exchange-Rate-Prediction-using-VAR-SVM-and-LSTM

In todayâ€™s global economy, accuracy in
predicting macro-economic parameters such as the foreign
exchange rate or at least estimating the trend correctly is of
key importance for any future investment. In recent times, the
use of computational intelligence-based techniques for
forecasting macroeconomic variables has been proven highly
successful. This project tries to come up with a multivariate time
series approach to forecast the exchange rate (USD/INR) while
parallelly comparing the performance of three multivariate
prediction modelling techniques: Vector Auto Regression (a
Traditional Econometric Technique), Support Vector Machine
(a Contemporary Machine Learning Technique), and
Recurrent Neural Networks (a Contemporary Deep Learning
Technique). We have used monthly historical data for several
macroeconomic variables from April 1994 to December 2018
for USA and India to predict USD-INR Foreign Exchange
Rate. The results clearly depict that contemporary techniques
of SVM and RNN (Long Short-Term Memory) outperform the
widely used traditional method of Auto Regression. The RNN
model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) provides the
maximum accuracy (97.83%) followed by SVM Model
(97.17%) and VAR Model (96.31%). At last, we present a brief
analysis of the correlation and interdependencies of the
variables used for forecasting.
